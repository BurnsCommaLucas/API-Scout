# API-Scout

A small scale API testing tool built explicitly for the Mac. 

Currently handles a very minimal set of functionality and is not a well-behaved app by a long shot.

This is both the first Mac App and the first Swift I have written. If you have interest in this product, please bear with me as I learn.

As much of the UI as possible is written with SwiftUI just because that's proven to be the simplest for 90% of what I want this app to do. Turns out [ATP](https://atp.fm) was right, SwiftUI is really great until you find something it can't do, and then it's back down to AppKit.[^1]

## Planned Additions & Improvements
This isn't an exhaustive list â€“ though it is an exhausting list to write (ba dum tiss) â€“ it's just the things I can think of off the top of my head that probably belong in either of A) a well behaved Mac App, or B) An API testing App.

[^1]: Anyone know a good resource for learning AppKit and how the hell custom `NSViewRepresentable`s work?

[^2]: Honestly not sure if this is something I'll need to handle specifically or if that's a system thing I can just latch on to
