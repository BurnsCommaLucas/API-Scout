# API-Scout

A small scale API testing tool built explicitly for the Mac. 

Currently handles a very minimal set of functionality and is not a well-behaved app by a long shot.

This is both the first Mac App and the first Swift I have written. If you have interest in this product, please bear with me as I learn.

As much of the UI as possible is written with SwiftUI just because that's proven to be the simplest for 90% of what I want this app to do. Turns out [ATP](https://atp.fm) was right, SwiftUI is really great until you find something it can't do, and then it's back down to AppKit.[^1]

## Planned Additions & Improvements

  - [x] Rendering SVG from response body
  - [ ] Copy header items directly to clipboard
- [ ] Environment
  - [ ] Variables
  - [ ] Variable groups
- [ ] Auth
  - [ ] Bearer
  - [ ] Basic

  - [ ] Forms
  - [ ] Custom
  - [ ] GraphQL (maybe)
- [ ] Cookies (maybe??)
- [ ] Better UI ðŸ˜°

This isn't an exhaustive list â€“ though it is an exhausting list to write (ba dum tiss) â€“ it's just the things I can think of off the top of my head that probably belong in either of A) a well behaved Mac App, or B) An API testing App.

I can also tell already there will be some things I'd like to implement that are just impractical or not feasiable.[^2] For cases like that, I'll probably make a note of them here and come back to them if I ever want to dive down any of those particualr rabbit holes.


[^1]: Anyone know a good resource for learning AppKit and how the hell custom `NSViewRepresentable`s work?
[^2]: For example, a `GET` with a body; I know it's not *technically* in spec for HTTP to allow that, but I've worked personally with some poorly behaved APIs that require just that. Unfortunately, the `URLSession` system prohibits `GET`s with a body, so I'd have to do a lot of extra work integrating a substitute network stack to get there. Doesn't feel worth it, but if I hear a lot of feedback that it would benefit people, I would consider finding a solution to add it.
